QRCodeScanner should work fine but for larger implementation we may have to use the rawData of QR's as the user has to be able to give their own QR, and their maybe problems with saving their QR image 
if that is a requirement we should hope to fulfill (we may not need to worry about it because the user is scanning a QR code they have so they can distribute it without us re providing it but it would
make for a good feature if I can figure it out).
